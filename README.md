# Clojure - 'learning Module'  

The following project completed for the course cse121a at Brigham Young University Idaho  

### About this Project  

The user will be prompted to several options to learn more information on Clojure-exclusive abstract concepts. The project itself was made to demonstrate and exercise within the source code the core Clojure concepts and understanding.  

### Execution  

The program 'leinegan' will need to be used in order to initialize the classpaths and hierarchy of instructions.  
Once installed, the following command should be run within any party of the project directory:  

> lein run  


### IDE used  
Everything was done using a text editor: a vim-based Emacs distribution named 'DOOM Emacs'
