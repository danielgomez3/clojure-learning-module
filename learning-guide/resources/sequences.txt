SEQUENCES

Clojure defines many algorithms in terms of sequences (seqs). A seq is a logical list, and unlike most Lisps where the list is represented by a concrete, 2-slot structure, Clojure uses the ISeq interface to allow many data structures to provide access to their elements as sequences. The seq function yields an implementation of ISeq appropriate to the collection. Seqs differ from iterators in that they are persistent and immutable, not stateful cursors into a collection. As such, they are useful for much more than foreach - functions can consume and produce seqs, they are thread safe, they can share structure etc.
